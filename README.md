# **HEIST**

**HEIST** is a generic framework for guiding the implementation of hybrid XAI-based Socio-Technical systems via a combination of data-driven and KR-based models. This architecture has five components:
- Data Ingestion: A variety of data sources feeds this module that is responsible for handling different issues that arise from integration of heterogeneous sources, such as cleaning, schema matching, inconsistency, incompleteness, as well as other higher-level issues such as trust and uncertainty management.
- Sub-symbolic Services: There are many tasks that address a variety of problems that are better handled by data-driven services; this module aids in the isolation of application scenarios for each service in order to foster faster deployment, replacement with alternative implementations, and build more reliable explanations.
- Symbolic Reasoning: General problems are, in many cases, better handled by high-level reasoning; this module, which can be considered to be the main one in the framework, and is fed from both data pre-processed by the Data Ingestion Module and outputs generated by Sub-symbolic Services. In order to take advantages of inference processes, rule-based systems are typically used to carry out high-level tasks such as combining data and low-level knowledge or answering queries using well-defined reasoning mechanisms over highly-structured knowledge. The reasoning processes implemented here are the main drivers behind answering queries issued by users.
- Explanations: Different kinds of explanations associated with query answers are implemented in this module, via access to the Symbolic Reasoning (via the Query Answering module) and Sub-symbolic Services modules.
- Query Answering: Finally, this module is responsible for answering user queries, which this requires coordinating the execution of the rest of the modules

An implementation that extends **HEIST** is provided in branch [netder_from_heist](https://github.com/jnparedes/HEIST/tree/netder_from_heist)
